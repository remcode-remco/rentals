Here, the warmth of old wood, all the comforts of modernity and the beauty of art work together in harmony.\n\nImagine waking up to a breathtaking view of the mountains, then starting your day with a refreshing dip in the heated pool. After a pleasant lunch in one of the resort's restaurants, return to relax in the chalet's hammam or sauna. In the evening, gather round the fire to share anecdotes from the day or organise a film night in the cinema. To round off the day in style, gaze up at the stars from the lush garden, lulled by the quietude of the surrounding countryside.",
